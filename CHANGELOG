- Added the new command MultisampleVariantsDetector to perform integrated
  variant detection over a collection of multiple samples. This is now the
  recommended method to perform variants detection on genotype-by-sequencing

- FindVariants: Improved the realignment around small indels and STRs to
  improve quality of detection and genotyping of these variants 
- FindVariants: The default behavior now only runs the SNV and small indel
  caller. Replaced options -noRep, -noRD and -noRP with -runRep -runRD and
  -runRP.

  in repetitive regions predicted by the clustering algorithm based on
  non-unique alignments
- VCF IO: Genotype likelihoods can now be read and written from the GL field
  The genotype quality can be a real number to allow reading this field from
  Freebayes VCF files

v3.1.1 30-01-2018
- RelativeAlleleCounts: Statistics are now calculated not only for the entire
  genome but also by chromosome
- The name of the command Deconvolute is now Demultiplex. Added option "-a" to
  allow dual barcoding of paired-end reads. In this mode, the barcode map must
  have at least 5 columns, being column 3 and 4 the R1 and R2 barcodes and the
  5th column the sample ID
- QualStats: Deprecated option "-ignoreXS". Added option "-minMQ" to set the
  minimum mapping quality to consider an alignment unique
- FindVariants: Deprecated option "-ignoreXS". Added option "-minMQ" to set the
  minimum mapping quality to consider an alignment unique
- CoverageStats: Added option "-minMQ" to set the minimum mapping quality to
  consider an alignment unique
- CompareVCF: Indel events in overlapping but not exact positions can now be
  matched if their alleles are consistent. This improves the accuracy of the
  comparison. To achieve this improvement, this module now requires the
  complete reference sequence and not just the sequence names
- Annotate: Added annotations of variation in splicing donor and acceptor
  sites and splice regions. Loss of start codons previously annotated as
  missense are now properly annotated. Loss of stop codons previously annotated
  as nonsense are now properly annotated. Annotation terms are now compliant
  with sequence ontology terms

  particular the phase field is now properly handled
- SummaryStats: Improved statistics with separated counts for different variant
  categories and annotation types
- SummaryStats: Fixed error calculating numbers of minor and unique alleles per
  sample
- ImputeVCF: Fixed error for VCF files including information of allele copy
  number in the genotype entries      

v3.1.0 26-07-2017
- The VCF I/O now interprets correctly phasing information
- ImputeVCF: The imputation module now can impute genotypes and perform
  statistical phasing on heterozygus individuals. Parents can now be phased
  heterozygous individuals
- New command called VCFDistanceMatrixCalculator to calculate IBS distance
  matrices from a VCF
- New command NeighborJoining to execute the neighbor joining clustering
  algorithm from distance matrixes

- New command called RelativeAlleleCounts to calculate distributions of
  relative allele counts from BAM files and infer ploidy
- New command called KmerCounter to perform counting of kmers in either fasta
  or fastq files
- The VCF file writer was improved to print zeros in the fields BSDP and ADP
  when counts are not available. This improves compliance with the vcf validator
  of EBI
- DiversityStats: Added reference allele and frequency of the reference allele
  for each population

v3.0.1 08-08-2016
- New command called IntrogressionAnalysis which makes a window-based analysis
  to identify haplotypes common within one population and introgressed in
  samples of a different population. See the README.txt for usage details.
- FindVariants: Solved concurrency issue that made the read pair (RP)
  analysis fail on the Multi variants detector option in the graphical
  interface.
- FindVariants: Improved selection of possible alleles for indel or
  complex calls to improve speed on high coverage datasets
- FindVariants: Fixed error loading the NUF field having the number of
  uniquely aligned fragments for the repeats saved in the GFF format for
  structural variants. The field was saved as double but it was loaded as an
  integer. The field is now saved as an integer but now can be loaded as a
  double for backwards compatibility.
- Annotate: Fixed error that made the process fail with entries without
  alternative alleles. Now these sites are just written back to the output
  VCF as they, by definition, do not store any variation to annotate.

v3.0.0 07-07-2016
- The parent package name for the complete aplication was changed from
  "net.sf.ngstools" to "ngsep". Several improvements in the object model were
  performed to improve memory management and in some cases reduce running
  times. The classes from picard for management of SAM/BAM files were updated
  to the latest version, now called htslib. Dependency to these classes was
  reduced to facilitate future updates.
- Added the command "AlleleSharingStats" to calculate allele sharing diversity
  statistics on populations of inbred samples
- Input VCF files over the whole application can now be gzip compressed.
- FilterVCF: Added filters of minimum and maximum observed heterozygosity.

v2.1.5 26-01-2016
- Deconvolute: This function can now receive a tab-delimited file
  describing locations of several fastq files (See README.txt for details).
  This is useful to deconvolute more than one lane in one command and to merge
  automatically reads from samples sequenced more than one time. The flowcell,
  lane and fastq input files are now optional and are ignored if a file
  descriptor for multilane decolnvolution is provided.
- Deconvolute: Input fastq files can now be gzip compressed.
- Deconvolute: Lanes sequenced in paired-end mode can now be deconvoluted. In
  this mode, two files should be provided and two files are generated for each
  sample to preserve the read pair information.
- Deconvolute: The barcode index file now must have a header line
- FindVariants: Added read pair analysis within duplications predicted by read
  depth to predict if the duplication is in tandem or is interspersed. Added
  info fields to the output GFF file to indicate for each CNV if is a deletion,
  a tandem duplication or an interspersed (trans) duplication and to provide 
  the number of reads supporting these predictions (See README.txt for details)
- FindVariants: Fixed error in detection of inversions

v2.1.4 19-10-2015
- FindVariants: Users can now add a file with short tandem repeat regions.
  These regions will now be called as one single region instead of individual
  pileups
- FindVariants: Improved algorithm for indel realignment
- FindVariants: Added a TYPE attribute to the variants different than biallelic
  SNVs
- FindVariants: Information on copy number variation within the VCF file has
  been moved out of the GT field and now is stored in the format field ACN 
  (allele copy number). The field LPL was also removed.
- In the VCF format field, the fields with read counts per allele,
  previously called AC and AAC now are called ADP and BSDP respectively.
- ConvertVCF: In the converter to Plink, changed genotype format from 1,2,3,4
  to ACGT 

v2.1.3 14-07-2015
- Output fastq files after deconvolution are now gzip compressed. 
  Added option "-u" to keep them uncompressed (Mainly for windows).
  
v2.1.2 30-04-2015
- The distribution jar file now has version number
- Added the options -maxPCTOverlapCNVs, -maxLenDeletion, -minSVQuality
  and -sizeSRSeed to control the behavior of the read pair analysis.
  SEE README.txt for details of each parameter 
- ConvertVCF: In the conversion to Plink, chromosomes in the .map file 
  have now numerical indexes  
- ConvertVCF: Added option to convert to rrBLUP
- Command line help is now available for every command using the --help option

  information. Added the option -algCNV to decide which read depth algorithms
  should be called
- Added breakpoint resolution to the read-pair analysis to find large indels
  based on realignment of reads likely to span the breakpoint site
- Fixed error with the header in the conversion to DARWin 

v2.1.1 13-02-15
- ImputeVCF: Fixed error when a SNP has only heterozygous genotypes
- ImputeVCF: Genotypes of unrelated inbred varieties can now be imputed
- ImputeVCF: Removed options -m and -e for percentages of missing data and
  heterozygous. Now these parameters are estimated from the data. Added option
  -k to specify the number of haplotype clusters (or the number of parents
  for breeding populations) 
- DiversityStats: Added support to standard input

v2.1.0 22-12-14
- Added new command to compare two VCF files.
- Added new command to impute missing genotypes in inbred multiparental populations.
- Added new command to identify significant differences between the read depth
  distributions of two samples. We implemented the algorithm called CNVSeq
  (See http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/80)
- VCFConverter can now convert to Darwin, Joinmap and TreeMix
- Added the options -u and -d to the functional annotator to control the offsets before
  and after each gene to classify a variant as upstream or downstream
- QualStats now can receive multiple bam files. The read length is now calculated from
  the alignments so it does not need to be provided. Added the option "-ignoreXS" to
  ignore this field in the bam file  as an indicator for a read with multiple alignments
  (Same behavior as that within the variants detector)
- VCFFilter now allows to select more than one annotation with the -a parameter.
  Annotations should be comma-separated
- Added option -ignoreProperPairFlag to the variants detector to ignore this flag
  while running the read pair algorithm
- The options -noStructural and -noNewCNV have been replaced with -noRP and -noRD
  respectively to reflect better that they are used to turn down the read pair
  and read depth analysis but both produce structural variants. The option -noNewCNV
  still exists but has a new meaning. By default, the read depth analysis genotypes
  input CNVs and repeats and then tries to find new CNVs. Using the option -noNewCNV
  the variants detector still builds the read depth distribution and genotypes input
  CNVs but it does not try to find new CNVs 
- Eliminated output file .cnv with CNVs and repeats in the variants detector.
  The option -knownCNVs has been replaced with -knownSVs and the format of the
  input file for this option is now GFF. 
- MergeVCF now does not try to merge variants in the same location with different
  alleles. A warning is logged everytime this situation is identified and two
  variants are reported in the output VCF. This eliminates entries with
  inconsistent information between the variant alleles and the calls.

v2.0.7 22-09-14
- Added module to calculate diversity statistics per site including a
  Chi-square test for deviation from HWE and F-statistics.
- Included total alignment counts for each length in the quality statistics to
  deal with reads having variable lengths
- Fixed error in the VCFFilter processing VCF files not generated by NGSEP
- Added an option to the variants detector to ignore the XS field as an
  indicator for a read with multiple alignments. The XS field was used by
  default in previous versions because bowtie2 outputs this filed only for reads
  with more than one alignment. However bwa-mem and bwa-sw output this field
  for every aligment, which produced errors in the algorithms to identify
  CNVs, repeats and structural variation.

v 2.0.6 04-08-2014
- Added conversion to PHASE for statistical phasing
- Added a new command to produce summary statistics based on a VCF file
- Added the options -saf and -fs to the FilterVCF command to select or filter
  samples with ids loaded from a text file
- Changed the default behavior of FilterVCF regarding quality and fixed alleles.
  Now the program by default will not perform any filtering. Because the option
  -v loss meaning under this behavior, it was replaced by the options -fi, -fir
  and -fia to filter respectively all the invariant sites, invariant sites
  having only the reference allele, and invariant sites having only an
  alternative allele 
- Added an optional header with sample id and ploidy to the VCF file. This header
  is later used by the FilterVCF command to recalculate properly the number of
  samples with CNVs while filtering samples
- Added a format field to the VCF files indicating for each genotype the local
  ploidy of the region surrounding the variant

v 2.0.5 27-01-2014
- Improved speed loading vcf files
- Added conversion to MapDisto
- Variant ids in VCF files are now properly loaded
- MergeVariants now keeps in the output vcf file SNVs within indels

v 2.0.4. 07-10-2013
- Changed default min coverage in the filter to avoid filtering variants without
  coverage information
- Added parameter in the filter to select variants within a set of regions
- Conversion to matrix and to hapmap now consumes much less memory
- Fixed error writing vcf files when allele count information is not available
- Fixed error loading SNVs when the reference allele is N (e.g. VCF files produced
  by samtools)
- Fixed error loading genotypes from a VCF file in which the number of fields per
  genotype does not match the number of fields in the genotype format column
- Fixed error loading genotypes from a VCF file in which the genotype quality
  or the coverage is not available.
- VCFMerge now keeps sites in which all called genotypes are homozygous reference
