**What it does**

After producing the second set of vcf files, with the genotypes of each sample at each variation locus, the next step is to join these new vcf files.
This command will write the final vcf file with the genotype calls for each variant on each sample.

The Sequence Names file is a text file which just has the ids of the sequences in the reference. It is used to determine the order of the reference sequences.

-----

**Output format**

A population VCF file, containing the whole set of samples and their genotypes at each variant position.
