**What it does**

Calculates the number of positions in the reference that are covered by reads at each coverage level from 1 to a maximum.

This statistic is useful to visualize how uniform was the sequencing process over the genome.

The alignments file must be given in BAM format. 

-----

**Output format**

Tab-delimited file with three columns::

	1. Coverage
	2. Number of reference sites with this coverage (Considering all alignments)
	3. Number of reference sites with this coverage (Considering only reads with unique alignments)
