**What it does**

Takes a set of alignments and a reference genome and counts the number of mismatches with the reference for each read position from 5' to 3' end. This report is useful to detect sequencing error biases.

-----

**Output format**

A text file with five columns::

	1. Position: 1-based from 5' to 3'
	2. Number of reads with a base call different than the reference (Considering all alignments)
	3. Number of reads with a base call different than the reference (Considering only reads with unique alignments)
	4. Number of total alignments counted with read length equal or larger than the position in the first column. 
	    The percentage of mismatches including all alignments is the ratio of column 2 divided by this column
	5. Number of uniquely aligned reads counted with read length equal or larger than the position in the first column.
	    The percentage of mismatches for uniquely aligned reads is the ratio of column 3 divided by this column
